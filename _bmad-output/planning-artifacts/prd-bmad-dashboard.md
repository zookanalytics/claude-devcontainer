# Product Requirements Document - BMAD Orchestration Layer

**Author:** Node
**Date:** 2026-01-03

## Executive Summary

BMAD Dashboard is a unified command center for multi-DevPod development. See every workflow, every story, every heartbeat - and know exactly what to do next.

The core problem: BMAD methodology is effective, but scaling it across multiple parallel workstreams creates cognitive overhead. Developers must manually track which stories are assigned where, detect stuck workflows, and determine optimal next actions. This coordination tax grows with each additional DevPod.

The solution: A host-based dashboard that reads BMAD state files (sprint-status.yaml, .worker-state.yaml) from all DevPod workspaces, aggregates progress, and surfaces actionable next steps with ready-to-run commands.

### What Makes This Special

**Confidence through clarity.** The dashboard doesn't just show status - it eliminates decision paralysis by making the next action obvious. Users stop asking "where are we?" and start executing.

**Git-native state architecture.** No new databases or sync infrastructure. Each DevPod writes its own state files; the orchestrator is read-only. State flows through git like all other BMAD artifacts.

**Progressive automation.** Start with visibility and manual commands (Phase 1), evolve to one-click dispatch (Phase 2), then autonomous execution with approval gates (Phase 3). Value delivered immediately, automation added incrementally.

**Lean orchestration core.** The orchestration logic leverages Claude Agent SDK to replace ~4200 LOC of fragile PTY coordination with ~635 LOC of structured invocation. Note: dashboard UI is additional scope beyond core orchestration.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** CLI tool + Developer tool hybrid
**Domain:** General (developer tooling)
**Complexity:** Medium - multi-instance coordination with known patterns
**Project Context:** Brownfield - extending existing claude-devcontainer system
**Deployment Model:** Host-based (reads DevPod filesystems via mounted workspaces)

### Phase 1 Scope (MVP)

- Dashboard aggregating state from all DevPods
- Copy-paste commands for manual dispatch
- Heartbeat monitoring and stale detection
- No Claude Agent SDK integration yet

The orchestrator integrates with:
- Existing BMAD workflows and state files
- DevPod for container lifecycle management
- Existing claude-instance tooling (tmux integration)

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**Core Success Metric:** "I know what to work on next."

- Open dashboard → immediately see next action → execute with confidence
- Works whether you have 1 DevPod or 5
- Portable across any BMAD project, not just one codebase
- **"Aha!" moment:** Clone a new repo, run the dashboard, and without reading docs know exactly where the project is and what to do next

### Business Success

| Horizon | Success Indicator |
|---------|-------------------|
| **1 month** | Still using it, happily evolving it (dogfooding success) |
| **3 months** | Almost exclusively using this as the interface into BMAD |
| **Longer term** | Quality bar = "good enough to publish without embarrassment" |

### Technical Success

| Dimension | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| **Code Quality** | Clear, understandable architecture over minimal LOC. "I can read it and know what does what." |
| **Platform** | Mac + Linux support. TUI preferred, Web UI acceptable if superior. |
| **Hackability** | Owner can modify easily. No plugin system needed, but good structure that enables future extensibility. |
| **Communication** | Reliable and simple. Not complicated and brittle - that defeats the entire purpose. |

### Measurable Outcomes

- Dashboard renders full state within 2 seconds of launch
- Stale worker detection fires reliably (no false negatives)
- Commands provided are copy-paste ready (no manual editing required)
- New project onboarding: working dashboard in <5 minutes

## Product Scope

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

What must work for this to be useful:

- Dashboard shows all DevPods + story status at a glance
- Surfaces next action clearly per worker
- Provides copy-paste commands for manual dispatch
- Heartbeat monitoring with stale detection
- Runs on Mac and Linux
- Host-based, reads DevPod filesystems

### Growth Features (Post-MVP)

What makes it pleasant to live in:

- One-click dispatch (still user-initiated, but no copy-paste)
- Enhanced visualization (Kanban view of stories across workers)
- Project-agnostic operation (works on any BMAD project without configuration)
- Improved status refresh (real-time or near-real-time updates)

### Vision (Future)

The dream version:

- Autonomous dispatch with human approval gates
- Claude Agent SDK integration for structured skill invocation
- Publishable quality for broader BMAD community
- Potential integration as official BMAD tooling

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Node - The Morning Orchestration

Node starts his day with three DevPods running from yesterday - one finishing a story, one mid-implementation, one that was supposed to run overnight. He opens VS Code and sees three workspaces in his dock. *Which one needs attention first?*

He could cycle through each, run `/workflow-status`, piece together the picture. But today he opens BMAD Dashboard instead.

One glance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BMAD Dashboard - claude-devcontainer                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  DevPod-1  │ 1-3-auth-flow    │ ✓ done        │ 2h ago     │
│  DevPod-2  │ 2-1-api-layer    │ ● running     │ 12m ago    │
│  DevPod-3  │ 2-2-persistence  │ ⏸ needs-input │ 6h ago     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Backlog: 1-4-tests, 2-3-validation, 2-4-integration        │
│  Next suggested: DevPod-1 is idle → assign 1-4-tests        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

DevPod-3 needs input - Claude asked a question overnight that went unanswered. DevPod-1 finished and is idle. DevPod-2 is humming along. Without opening a single VS Code window, Node knows: answer DevPod-3's question, then assign new work to DevPod-1.

The dashboard shows the command for the idle DevPod:

```
devpod ssh devpod-1 -- claude -p "/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story 1-4-tests" --output-format json
```

Copy. Paste. Execute. Back to the dashboard. On to the next decision.

By the time he finishes his coffee, Node has answered DevPod-3's question, confirmed it resumed successfully, and dispatched two new stories. Total time: 8 minutes. Total context switches: zero.

### Journey 2: The Needs-Input Resolution

Node sees DevPod-3 showing `⏸ needs-input` with last activity 6 hours ago. Claude asked a question that went unanswered overnight.

He drills into the detail view:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DevPod-3: devpod-3-persistence                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Story: 2-2-persistence                                      │
│  Status: needs-input (waiting 6h)                            │
│  Session: ab2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890                │
│                                                              │
│  Claude is asking:                                           │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ "Test repository_save_test is failing with error:       │ │
│  │  'Connection refused on port 5432'.                     │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  Should I:                                              │ │
│  │  (1) Fix by mocking the database connection             │ │
│  │  (2) Update test to use test container                  │ │
│  │  (3) Skip test and document as known issue"             │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                                              │
│  Progress before pause:                                      │
│  └── tasks completed: 3/7                                    │
│  └── last task: "Implementing repository pattern"           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Resume with answer:  [1_______________] [Send]              │
│                                                              │
│  Or: [Interactive Mode] - attach to tmux for conversation   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For this straightforward question, Node types "1" and clicks Send. The dashboard generates:

```
devpod ssh devpod-3 -- claude -p "1" --resume "ab2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" --output-format json
```

The command executes. Claude resumes with the answer, mocks the database connection, and continues implementing. The dashboard refreshes: DevPod-3 now shows `● running`.

**For complex situations**, Node could click [Interactive Mode] to attach via tmux and have a back-and-forth conversation. But for clear transactional decisions like this? One answer, structured response, back to orchestrating.

### Architectural Decision: Hybrid Execution Model

| Mode | When Used | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **JSON (default)** | Standard BMAD workflows | `--output-format json`, structured results, orchestrator-friendly |
| **Interactive (escape hatch)** | Complex debugging, extended conversation | tmux attach, full back-and-forth, manual control |

Most BMAD steps are transactional: dispatch a skill, get a result. JSON mode makes these reliable and parseable. Interactive mode remains available for situations requiring human judgment beyond a simple answer.

### Journey Requirements Summary

| Capability | Revealed By |
|------------|-------------|
| **Unified status view** | Journey 1 - see all DevPods at a glance |
| **Idle worker detection** | Journey 1 - know which DevPod can take work |
| **Needs-input detection** | Journey 1 & 2 - surface questions immediately |
| **Question display** | Journey 2 - show exactly what Claude is asking |
| **Session ID tracking** | Journey 2 - enable structured resume |
| **Resume with answer** | Journey 2 - single-field response for simple decisions |
| **Interactive escape hatch** | Journey 2 - drop to tmux when needed |
| **Copy-paste commands** | Journey 1 - zero-friction execution |
| **JSON mode dispatch** | Both - reliable, structured orchestration |
| **Progress visibility** | Journey 2 - tasks completed before pause |

## CLI + Developer Tool Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

BMAD Dashboard is a hybrid CLI/developer tool:
- **TUI component:** Persistent dashboard for visual orchestration
- **CLI component:** Individual commands for scripting and automation
- **Developer tool aspect:** Designed for modification and extension by owner

### Technical Architecture

**Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript
- Consistency with existing claude-instance tooling
- Mature TUI libraries available (ink, blessed-contrib)
- Familiar ecosystem for owner modification

**Package Structure:**
- npm package within claude-devcontainer monorepo
- Entry point: `bmad-dashboard` (persistent TUI)
- Additional commands: `bmad-dashboard status`, `bmad-dashboard list`, etc.

### Command Structure

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bmad-dashboard` | Launch persistent TUI (default) |
| `bmad-dashboard status` | One-shot status dump (scriptable) |
| `bmad-dashboard list` | List discovered DevPods |
| `bmad-dashboard dispatch <devpod> <story>` | Generate/execute dispatch command |
| `bmad-dashboard resume <devpod> <answer>` | Resume needs-input session |

### Configuration & Discovery

**Auto-Discovery (zero-config):**
- Query `devpod list` for active instances
- Filter by naming convention (e.g., `devpod-*`, `{project}-*`)
- Detect workspace paths from DevPod metadata

**Optional Config Override:**
```yaml
# ~/.bmad-dashboard.yaml (optional)
devpods:
  include: ["devpod-*"]
  exclude: ["devpod-test-*"]
workspaces_root: "~/.devpod/workspaces"
```

### Output Formats

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| **TUI** | Rich terminal UI with colors, borders, status indicators |
| **CLI commands** | Plain text default, `--json` flag for structured output |
| **Generated commands** | Copy-paste ready shell commands |

### Shell Completion

- Leverage `yargs` or `commander` built-in completion support
- Complete DevPod names, story IDs from discovered state
- Install via: `bmad-dashboard completion >> ~/.bashrc`

### Installation Method

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm install

# Or if published
npm install -g @claude-devcontainer/bmad-dashboard
```

### Scripting Support

CLI commands designed for pipeline integration:
```bash
# Check if any DevPod needs input
bmad-dashboard status --json | jq '.devpods[] | select(.status == "needs-input")'

# Auto-dispatch to idle workers
for pod in $(bmad-dashboard list --idle); do
  bmad-dashboard dispatch $pod --next-story
done
```

## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Problem-Solving MVP
- Solve the core cognitive load problem: "Which DevPod needs attention? What should I do next?"
- Deliver working visibility before adding automation
- Value delivered immediately, automation added incrementally

**Resource Requirements:** Solo developer with TypeScript/Node experience

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

**Core User Journeys Supported:**
- Journey 1: Morning Orchestration (full support)
- Journey 2: Needs-Input Resolution (full support)

**Must-Have Capabilities:**

| Capability | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Unified status view | This IS the product - see all DevPods at a glance |
| Copy-paste commands | Enables immediate action from dashboard |
| Stale/needs-input detection | Surfaces problems before they become blockers |
| Auto-discovery | Existing capability in claude-instance, must preserve |
| Session ID tracking | Required for structured resume workflow |

**Explicitly Deferred:**
- One-click dispatch (Phase 2)
- Kanban visualization (Phase 2)
- Autonomous execution (Phase 3)
- Claude Agent SDK integration (Phase 3)

### Post-MVP Features

**Phase 2 (Growth):**
- One-click dispatch from dashboard (no copy-paste)
- Enhanced visualization (Kanban view of stories)
- Project-agnostic operation (works on any BMAD project)
- Real-time status refresh

**Phase 3 (Vision):**
- Autonomous dispatch with human approval gates
- Claude Agent SDK integration for structured invocation
- Publishable quality for broader community

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:**
- JSON parsing: Use Claude's `--output-format json` for predictable structure
- TUI complexity: Start with proven library (ink), keep UI minimal

**Adoption Risks:**
- Dashboard as "yet another tool": Position as THE interface, not an addition
- Measure success by reduction in VS Code window cycling

**Scope Risks:**
- Automation temptation: Strict Phase 1 boundary - copy-paste only
- Feature creep: Success criterion is "still using it at 1 month", not feature count
